# DataFest
DataFest Project 
 
This project looked at new ways of incorporating measurements of player fatigue. The datasets from the Canadian National Women's Rugby Team (in the 2017-2018 season) provided us numerous observations useful in measuring fatigue/its effects on players' performance and physical wellness.
